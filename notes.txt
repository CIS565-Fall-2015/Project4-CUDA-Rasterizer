add:
-anti-aliasing
-tessellation shader + wireframe shading OR instancing
-tile based pipeline

TESSELATION
-every triangle gets an "innter" value and 4 "outer" values
-wat

INSTANCING
-we'll do it two ways
	-serial instancing: multiple draws between buffer wipes
	-parallel instancing: allocates more memory every time number of instances changes
		-more memory in the primitives buffer
		-add new kernels for parallel instancing
		
-btw there's a problem where the fragment shader doesn't work on lab machines. wtf.
